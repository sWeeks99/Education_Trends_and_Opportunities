# Project-1-Group-2

For this project, we focused our efforts within researching the best colleges to enroll in the United States of America. From a sample size of 453 colleges sorted between private and public schools, we narrowed down the best colleges by their availabilities, acceptance/graduation rates and total costs (tuition fees, personal spendings, book costs, and room & board prices per semester). 

From what we found: private schools are in a higher quantity compared than private schools, average acceptance rates are slightly more in favor of public schools but private schools have better graduation rates, and public schools have cheaper total costs compared to private schools.

We also conducted further research that would provide more context and information such as the relationship between totail tuition costs and starting medium income, how do STEM degrees factor into better pay, and what are the top 10 schools with the best expected career pay with the best affordability.
