## About
* <b>Project Summary:</b><br>

For this project, we focused our efforts within researching the best colleges to enroll in the United States of America. From a sample size of 453 colleges sorted between private and public schools, we narrowed down the best colleges by their availabilities, acceptance/graduation rates and total costs (tuition fees, personal spendings, book costs, and room & board prices per semester). 

- <b>Objectives:</b> <br>
  -Identify what colleges provide the best return on investment of career earnings.
  -Inform new applicants that are deciding between different colleges.
  -Analyze what colleges offer the most bang for your buck.
  -Understand how promising degrees like STEM can lead to high-starting salaries
